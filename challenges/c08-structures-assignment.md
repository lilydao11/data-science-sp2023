*Purpose*: Most real problems have multiple sources of uncertainty mixed
together. Untangling these different sources can be challenging, even on
a conceptual level. In this challenge we’ll study a simple problem of
structural safety, and use this small case study to untangle sources of
sampling and Monte Carlo uncertainty.

*Note*: In this challenge I provide a lot of stub-code; you won’t have
to do too much coding. This is because I want you to *focus on answering
the conceptual questions*. The most important questions in this
challenge are: *What sources of uncertainty are you accounting for? What
sources are you not accounting for? Are those sources real or induced?*

*Background*: The
[strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength) of a
material is the amount of mechanical stress it can survive before
breaking. To illustrate: Stresses are internal forces that hold an
object together when we try to squeeze, stretch, or otherwise deform a
solid object. For instance, if we pull on a rectangular bar of material,
internal stresses $\sigma$ work to keep the bar together.

*Strength* is a measure of how much internal stress an object can
survive: A higher strength means a stronger material. This challenge’s
data are very simple: They are (synthetic) observations of ultimate
tensile strength (UTS) on individual samples of the same aluminum alloy.
The experiments were carried out following the higest standards of
experimental rigor, so you should consider these values to be the “true”
breaking strength for each sample.

### **q1** Visualize the strength data with a histogram. Answer the questions below.

histogram <-
  df_samples %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = strength)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=100)
histogram
```

![](c08-structures-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- What is the mean strength of the material, approximately?
  - I would approximate the mean strength of the material to be just
    below 40000 psi at around 39900 psi. That being said, this histogram
    is not a great way of estimating this value. This is especially
    difficult due to the small number of data points.
- To what extent can you tell what shape the distribution of the data
  has?
  - With 25 data points in our data set, we can’t see the shape of the
    distribution with confidence. That being said, we do see a greater
    density of data in the left of our graph, leading me to believe that
    the graph is slightly skewed right. We would need more data points
    to verify the shape of the distribution.
- Assuming the scopus is the strength of an individual part made from
  this aluminum alloy, is the observed variability real or induced?
  - The variability is real because there are incosistencies in the
    manufacturing of parts that keeps one part from being identical to
    the other. Since we are to consider this the true breaking strength
    of the material, this implies that there was not induced
    variability.

# Assessing Structural Safety

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

*Objective*: In this challenge you are going to study a structure and
assess its *probability of failure* (POF). A higher POF corresponds to a
more unsafe structure. Ultimately, we want

$$\text{POF} < 0.03.$$

Your job is to assess a given structure using the data provided and
determine whether you can *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`.

## Structural model

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

The following code chunk sets up a structural model: We are considering
a rectangular bar under uniaxial tensile load (as pictured above). A
larger cross-sectional area `A` is capable of surviving a greater load
`L`, but a larger `A` is a heavier (more expensive) structure. The
internal stress is approximately `sigma = L / A`—we simply compare this
quantity against the strength.

I pick particular values for `A, L` and package all the information in
the *limit state function* `g_break`:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; model setup
A <- 0.0255 # Cross-sectional area
L <- 1000 # Applied load (lbs)

g_break <- function(strength) {
  strength - L / A
}
```

The *probability of failure* (POF) is then defined in terms of the limit
state $g$ via:

$$\text{POF} \equiv \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0].$$

### **q2** Using the observations in `df_samples` and the structural model `g_break()`, estimate the probability of failure.

*Hint*: In `c07-monte-carlo` you learned how to estimate a probability
as the `mean()` of an indicator. Use the same strategy here.

``` r
## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure; i.e. POF = Pr[g <= 0]
n <- 10000

pass_fail <- function(POF) {
  ifelse(POF >= 0, 0, 1)
}

sample_result <- df_samples$strength[sample(nrow(df_samples), n, replace = TRUE)]
does_break <- g_break(sample_result)
sample_pass_fail <- pass_fail(does_break)
prob_fail <- mean(sample_pass_fail)
prob_fail
```

    ## [1] 0

**Observations**:

- Does this estimate satisfy `POF < 0.03`?
  - This estimate does satisfy POF \< 0.03 because we got a POF of 0
    with these samples.
- Is this estimate of the probability of failure trustworthy? Why or why
  not?
  - This estimate of POF is not trustworthy because we have so few
    samples. With a POF of around .03, we would expect around 3 in every
    100 samples to fail. This means that we need to have significantly
    more samples than 25 to get a good idea of the actual POF for the
    material.
- Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not.
  - I cannot confidently conclude that POF for this material is less
    than 0.03. This is because we have so few samples. With only 25
    samples, it isn’t unlikely to get a POF of 0, but if we increased
    the samples to 1000, we would likely see some instances of failure.

## Material property model

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Since we have so few physical samples, we will fit a distribution to
model the material property. This will give us the means to draw
“virtual samples” and use those to estimate the POF.

### **q3** Fit a lognormal distribution to the strength data using the `fitdistr()` function.

*Note*: In this challenge I generated the `strength` data from a
`lognormal` distribution; if you didn’t know that fact, then the choice
of distribution would be an *additional* source of uncertainty!

*Hint 1*: We learned how to do this in `e-stat08-fit-dist`.

*Hint 2*: The `fitdistr` function uses `densfun = "lognormal"` to
specify a lognormal distribution.

``` r
strength <- df_samples[["strength"]]
df_fit <- 
  strength %>%
  fitdistr(densfun = "lognormal") %>%
  tidy()
df_fit
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 3
    ##   term    estimate std.error
    ##   <chr>      <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 meanlog 10.6       0.00175
    ## 2 sdlog    0.00875   0.00124

Once you’ve successfully fit a model for the strength, you can estimate
the probability of failure by drawing samples from the fitted
distribution.

### **q4** Complete the code below by 1. choosing a Monte Carlo sample size `n_monte_carlo`, 2. extracting the estimated parameters from q3, and 3. computing the limit state value `g = g_break()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint 1*: You will need to combine ideas from `c07-monte-carlo` and
`e-stat08-fit-dist` in order to complete this task.

*Hint 2*: The function `rlnorm()` will allow you to draw samples from a
lognormal distribution.

``` r
## TODO 1: Choose Monte Carlo sample size
n_monte_carlo <- 1000

## TODO 2: Extract parameter estimates from df_fit
strength_meanlog <- df_fit$estimate[1]
strength_sdlog <- df_fit$estimate[2]

# Generate samples
df_norm_sim <-
  tibble(strength = rlnorm(n_monte_carlo, strength_meanlog, strength_sdlog)) %>%
## TODO 3: Compute structural response
  mutate(g = g_break(strength)) %>%
  glimpse()
```

    ## Rows: 1,000
    ## Columns: 2
    ## $ strength <dbl> 40033.75, 40519.14, 39888.46, 40445.93, 39485.59, 40552.46, 3…
    ## $ g        <dbl> 818.0625, 1303.4490, 672.7766, 1230.2414, 269.8993, 1336.7779…

``` r
## NOTE: The following code estimates the POF and a 95% confidence interval
df_norm_pof <-
  df_norm_sim %>%
  mutate(stat = g <= 0) %>%
  summarize(
    pof_est = mean(stat),
    se = sd(stat) / sqrt(n_monte_carlo)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    pof_lo = pof_est - 1.96 * se,
    pof_hi = pof_est + 1.96 * se
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(pof_lo, pof_est, pof_hi)

df_norm_pof
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   pof_lo pof_est pof_hi
    ##    <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1 0.0113    0.02 0.0287

- Assuming your scopus is the probability of failure `POF` defined
  above, does your estimate exhibit real variability, induced
  variability, or both?
  - Our estimate exhibits real variability because there can be
    differences in the making of the samples but there can’t be induced
    variability since we are assuming we are receiving the true strength
    values. Our strength values are also generated by a log curve which
    would ensure there is no induced variability.
- Does this confidence interval imply that `POF < 0.03`?
  - Yes, the lower end of our confidence interval is about POF = .00898
    and the upper end is about POF = .0250. Our POF estimate is .017
    making it so our entire interval is below .03.
- Compare this probability with your estimate from q2; is it more or
  less trustworthy?
  - This estimate of probability is more trustworthy because we are
    using more samples to understand the probability of failure.
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
  from the *Monte Carlo approximation*? Why or why not?
  - Yes, we can see it in the calculating of the value ‘se’ (standard
    error). This value takes into account the uncertainty that
    inherently comes from using a Monte Carlo approximation. When we
    multiply the standard error in the confidence interval calculations,
    we are taking the uncertainty into account.
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
  from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
  - No, we didn’t use df_samples, we generated our own samples using the
    log fit estimates. That means that we did not account for limited
    physical tests in this confidence interval.
- What could you do to tighten up the confidence interval?
  - We could increase the amount of Monte Carlo simulations we do to
    tighten up the confidence interval.
- Can you *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
  - No, when running the code several times, there are instances where
    .03 falls in the confidence interval meaning that the probability of
    failure could be greater than .03.

## A different way to compute the POF

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Monte Carlo is a *general* way to estimate probabilities, but it
introduces approximation error. It turns out that, for the simple
problem we’re studying, we can compute the probability directly using
the CDF. Note that for our structural safety problem, we have

$$\text{POF} = \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0] = \mathbb{P}[S \leq L / A] = \text{CDF}_S(L/A).$$

Since
`S = rlnorm(n, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`, we
can use `plnorm` to compute the probability of failure without Monte
Carlo as
`POF = plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`.
Let’s combine this idea with the fitted distribution to estimate the
POF.

### **q5** Finish the following function by computing the POF with `plnorm()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
## TODO: Complete the function below;
##       note that you only need to edit the TODO section

estimate_pof <- function(df) {
  ## Fit the distribution
  df_fit <-
    df %>%
    pull(strength) %>%
    fitdistr(densfun = "lognormal") %>%
    tidy()

  ## Extract the parameters
  strength_meanlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "meanlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)
  strength_sdlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "sdlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)

## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure using plnorm
  pof_estimate <- 
    plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)

  ## NOTE: No need to edit; this last line returns your pof_estimate
  pof_estimate
}

## NOTE: No need to edit; test your function
df_samples %>% estimate_pof()
```

    ## [1] 0.01832289

**Observations**:

- How does this estimate compare with your Monte Carlo estimate above?
  - It is around the average of the Monte Carlo estimates above. I had
    some instances of .017, .018, and .019 estimates for POF. This
    estimate is around the mean of these instances.
- Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo
  approximation*? Why or why not?
  - There is not any uncertainty due to Monte Carlo approximation
    because there is no Monte Carlo approximation in this calculation of
    the estimate.
- With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo
  approximation* be induced or real?
  - There is no uncertainty due to Monte Carlo approximation, but if
    there was, it would be real uncertainty, not induced certainty.
- Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *limited physical
  tests*? Why or why not?
  - There is uncertainty in our estimate due to limited physical tests
    because if we increased our tests, we would see an increase in the
    certainty of our estimate.
- With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *limited
  physical tests* be induced or real?
  - Uncertainty due to limited physical tests would be real, not
    induced.

## Quantifying sampling uncertainty

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Using `plnorm()` gets rid of Monte Carlo error, but we still have
uncertainty due to limited physical testing. Often we can use a CLT
approximation to construct a confidence interval. However, with
`plnorm()` we can’t use a CLT approximation because it does not follow
the assumptions of the central limit theorem (it’s not a sum of iid
random variables). Instead, we can use the *bootstrap* to approximate a
confidence interval via resampling.

### **q6** The code below estimates a bootstrap CI on your POF estimate. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
tidycustom <- function(est) {tibble(term = "pof", estimate = est)}

df_samples %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000) %>%
  mutate(
    estimates = map(
      splits,
      ~ analysis(.x) %>% estimate_pof() %>% tidycustom()
    )
  ) %>%
  int_pctl(estimates)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 6
    ##   term   .lower .estimate .upper .alpha .method   
    ##   <chr>   <dbl>     <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>     
    ## 1 pof   0.00114    0.0181 0.0479   0.05 percentile

**Observations**:

- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
  from *Monte Carlo approximation* of the POF? Why or why not?
  - No, there is no uncertainty from a Monte Carlo approximation. This
    means that the confidence interval does not need to account for
    uncertainty arising from the Monte Carlo approximation.
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
  from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
  - No, while it does resample accounting for uncertainty in the values
    themselves, it does not account for the limited number of samples
    that are being processed through the data.
- Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
  - No, .03 falls in the confidence interval, meaning we could get POFs
    greater than 0.3. This means that although we do see many values of
    POF in the range of .17-.19, we cannot conclude with confidence due
    to the upper end of this confidence interval.
