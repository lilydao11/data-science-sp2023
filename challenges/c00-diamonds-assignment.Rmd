*Purpose*: Throughout this course, you'll complete a large number of *exercises* and *challenges*. Exercises are meant to introduce content with easy-to-solve problems, while challenges are meant to make you think more deeply about and apply the content. The challenges will start out highly-scaffolded, and become progressively open-ended.

In this challenge, you will go through the process of exploring, documenting, and sharing an analysis of a dataset. We will use these skills again and again in each challenge. 

*Note*: You will have seen all of these steps in `e-vis00-basics`. This challenge is *primarily* a practice run of the submission system. The Data Exploration part should be very simple.

# Grading Rubric
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Effort | Some task __q__'s left unattempted | All task __q__'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase "more data are necessary" without clarification | Any statement that "more data are necessary" specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission
<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without all files uploaded to GitHub.**


```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

# Data Exploration
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this first stage, you will explore the `diamonds` dataset and document your observations.

### __q1__ Create a plot of `price` vs `carat` of the `diamonds` dataset below. Document your observations from the visual.

*Hint*: We learned how to do this in `e-vis00-basics`!

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Plot `price` vs `carat` below
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

**Observations**:

- It seems that commonly, the carat value of a diamond will be a multiple of 0.5, perhaps due to ease of understanding for those who aren't knowledgeable with diamonds. As for the relationship with price and carat value, the relationship is positive with the higher carat value tending to cost more. Our dataset had more values of lower carat and cost values, likely due to these diamonds being more common than diamonds with high carat values. Adding on to this, there are very few diamonds in the dataset with a carat value of over 2.5. There is almost a "hard stop" around a price of $18k with most diamonds under a price of $10k.

### __q2__ Create a visualization showing variables `carat`, `price`, and `cut` simultaneously. Experiment with which variable you assign to which aesthetic (`x`, `y`, etc.) to find an effective visual.

```{r q2-task}
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut))
```

**Observations**:

- With this graph, we can see that, just as before, as the carat value increases, the price tends to increase. Now we have the value of the cut, which has shown that the ideal cut is quite spread out, spanning from a fraction of a carat and a few hundred dollars to over two carats and over $18k dollars. There seems to be a slight pattern with worse cuts lowering the value of the diamond, but there are still some diamonds with a fair cut that are going for over $10k. As for making the graph, I find cut being the variable shown through an aesthetic is the best since it maintains the clear positive correlation between carat and price that the other graphs (cut vs carat or cut vs price) did not display.


# Communication
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this next stage, you will render your data exploration, push it to GitHub to share with others, and link your observations within our [Data Science Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki).

### __q3__ *Knit* your document in order to create a report.

You can do this by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of your document in RStudio.

![Terminal](./images/c00-knit.png)

This will create a local `.md` file, and RStudio will automatically open a preview window so you can view your knitted document.

### __q4__ *Push* your knitted document to GitHub.

![Terminal](./images/c00-unstaged.png)

You will need to stage both the `.md` file, as well as the `_files` folder. Note that the `_files` folder, when staged, will expand to include all the files under that directory.

### __q5__ *Submit* your work to Canvas

Navigate to your GitHub repository's website and find the URL that corresponds to your report. Submit this to Canvas to complete the assignment.

### __q6__ *Prepare* to present your team's findings!

If your team is on-deck, you are responsible for putting together a discussion of the challenge. I'll demonstrate how to do this by leading the discussion of Challenge 0.
